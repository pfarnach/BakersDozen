# BAKER'S DOZEN ([Baker's Dozen](http://getskeleton.com))
Baker's Dozen is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project that adds an intuitive thirteenth column to the boring old twelve column standard.


### What's in the download?

The download includes Baker's Dozen's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, some custom CSS for the sample, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```

│	└── style.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Baker's Dozen is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive, intuitive thirteen column grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Baker's Dozen works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.

## Acknowledgement

Baker's Dozen was created by [Pat Farnach](http://patfarnach.com) for a better, more carbo-loaded web.

Also, I acknowledge that this is an April Fool's Day joke and the only work I did to make this was recalculating the column width's and the column offset's margins. All the real work was done by [Dave Gamache](https://twitter.com/dhg) and Baker's Dozen is just a cheap rip-off of Skeleton.
